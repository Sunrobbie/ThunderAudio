# ThunderAudio

ThunderAudio is the final result of my Embedded Systems project at Rowan University. 
Two different folders are uploaded here, one for use with Simplicity Studio and one for use with Mbed.
The Simplicity Studio project features a working classifier created using Edge Impulse and implemented onboard.
The Mbed project features a demonstration of reading the temperature data of a sensor and displaying it on and LCD screen using I2C
